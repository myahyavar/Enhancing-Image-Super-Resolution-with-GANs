This project will explore the use of GANs, particularly architectures like SRGAN (Super-Resolution GAN) or ESRGAN (Enhanced SRGAN), to upscale low-resolution images while maintaining or improving perceptual quality.

The project uses DIV2K Realistic Mild x4 dataset, the total database size is too big for uploading to GitHub but can be downloaded by https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/. Since the site doesn't provide the test dataset, the train and eval data are needs to be merged in one file for our own splits. The high resolution data is also needs to be downloaded for ground truth.

All the operations are done in ImageS-Res_GAN.ipynb.
